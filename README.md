The PHP ISBN library
-------------------

Can be used for both ISBN validation, translating, formatting and ISBN data lookups.

Lookups currently use Amazon to fetch ISBN data and populate a Book object.

This library is very much "in development" and will contain bugs, incomplete code and unfinished functionality.

Some code samples for ISBN code validating, translating, and formatting taken from: https://github.com/Fale/isbn
